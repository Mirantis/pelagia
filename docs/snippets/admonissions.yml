  !!! warning

      When using the non-recommended Ceph pools `replicated.size` of less than `3`, Ceph OSD removal cannot be performed. The minimal replica
      size equals a rounded up half of the specified `replicated.size`.

      For example, if `replicated.size` is `2`, the minimal replica size is
      `1`, and if `replicated.size` is `3`, then the minimal replica size
      is `2`. The replica size of `1` allows Ceph having PGs with only one
      Ceph OSD in the `acting` state, which may cause a `PG_TOO_DEGRADED`
      health warning that blocks Ceph OSD removal. Mirantis recommends setting
      `replicated.size` to `3` for each Ceph pool.

# Integrate Pelagia with Rockoon

This document describes how to integrate Pelagia with [Rockoon OpenStack Controllers](https://github.com/Mirantis/rockoon).
As Ceph supports integration with OpenStack, Pelagia provides a way to integrate Rook Ceph cluster with
Rockoon OpenStack inside the Kubernetes cluster.

## How to integrate Pelagia with Rockoon

In the `CephDeployment` custom resource, create the following Ceph pools required for Rockoon OpenStack and ensure that the `role` parameter is explicitly set:

- `volumes` for the OpenStack Block Storage service (`cinder`)
- `backup` for the OpenStack Block Storage service (`cinder`)
- `vms` for the OpenStack Compute service (`nova`)
- `images` for the OpenStack Image service (`glance`)

  For example:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    pools:
    ...
    - default: false
      deviceClass: hdd
      name: volumes
      replicated:
        size: 3
      role: volumes
    - default: false
      deviceClass: hdd
      name: backup
      replicated:
        size: 3
      role: backup
    - default: false
      deviceClass: hdd
      name: vms
      replicated:
        size: 3
      role: vms
    - default: false
      deviceClass: hdd
      name: images
      replicated:
        size: 3
      role: images
  ```

As a result, Pelagia creates the following Ceph pools: `volumes-hdd`, `backup-hdd`, `vms-hdd`, and
`images-hdd`. Target ratios will be automatically configured for these pools to match the default
OpenStack requirements:

  - Volumes pool: 0.4
  - Backup pool:  0.1
  - VMs pool:     0.2
  - Images pool:  0.1

Mirantis recommends adjusting these ratios according to your OpenStack
deployment requirements using the `parameters.target_size_ratio` parameter located in the `pools` section.

After Ceph pools are created, Pelagia Deployment Controller creates a secret in the `openstack-ceph-shared`
namespace with all necessary information for Rockoon OpenStack services to be configured
with the Ceph cluster. Rockoon Controller watches this namespace and
transforms the secret into the data structures expected by OpenStack Helm charts. After that, OpenStack
services will be connected to the desired Ceph cluster.

If `CephDeployment` contains the `objectStorage` section and Ceph Object Storage is deployed, then Pelagia and Rockoon
enable Ceph RADOS Gateway integration with OpenStack Object Storage service (`swift`).

# Move Ceph Monitor before node replacement

This document describes how to migrate a Ceph Monitor to another node
on bare metal-based clusters before node replacement.

!!! warning

    * Remove the Ceph Monitor role *before* the machine removal.
    * Make sure that the Ceph cluster always has an *odd* number of Ceph Monitors.

The procedure of a Ceph Monitor migration assumes that you temporarily move
the Ceph Manager/Monitor to another (for example, worker) node. After a node replacement, we
recommend migrating the Ceph Manager/Monitor to the new manager node.

**To migrate a Ceph Monitor to another machine:**

1. Move the Ceph Manager/Monitor daemon from the affected node to one of
   the worker machines as described in
   [Move a Ceph Monitor daemon to another node](https://mirantis.github.io/pelagia/ops-guide/deployment/move-mon-daemon).
2. Delete the affected node.
3. Add a new manager node without the Monitor and Manager role.

    !!! warning

         The addition of a new node with the Monitor and Manager role breaks the odd number quorum of Ceph Monitors.

4. Move the previously migrated Ceph Manager/Monitor daemon to the new manager
   node as described in
   [Move a Ceph Monitor daemon to another node](https://mirantis.github.io/pelagia/ops-guide/deployment/move-mon-daemon).

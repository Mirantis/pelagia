Can use only <code>replicated</code> settings. For example:</p> <pre><code>spec:\n  sharedFilesystem:\n    cephFS:\n    - name: cephfs-store\n      metadataPool:\n        deviceClass: nvme\n        replicated:\n          size: 3\n        failureDomain: host\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>replicated.size</code> is the number of full copies of data on multiple nodes.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Modifying of <code>metadataPool</code> on a deployed CephFS has no effect. You can manually adjust pool settings through the Ceph CLI. However, for any changes in <code>metadataPool</code>, we recommend re-creating CephFS.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>preserveFilesystemOnDelete</code> - Defines whether to delete the data and metadata pools if CephFS is deleted. Set to <code>true</code> to avoid occasional data loss in case of human error. However, for security reasons, we recommend setting <code>preserveFilesystemOnDelete</code> to <code>false</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>metadataServer</code> - Metadata Server settings correspond to the Ceph MDS daemon settings. Contains the following fields:</p> <ul> <li><code>activeCount</code> - the number of active Ceph MDS instances. As load increases, CephFS will automatically partition the file system across the Ceph MDS instances. Rook will create double the number of Ceph MDS instances as requested by <code>activeCount</code>. The extra instances will be in the standby mode for failover. We recommend specifying this parameter to <code>1</code> and increasing the MDS daemons count only in case of high load.</li> <li><code>activeStandby</code> - defines whether the extra Ceph MDS instances will be in active standby mode and will keep a warm cache of the file system metadata for faster failover. The instances will be assigned by CephFS in failover pairs. If <code>false</code>, the extra Ceph MDS instances will all be in passive standby mode and will not maintain a warm cache of the metadata. The default value is <code>false</code>.</li> <li><code>resources</code> - represents Kubernetes resource requirements for Ceph MDS pods.

The <code>failureDomain</code> parameter   may be set to <code>host</code>, <code>rack</code> and so on, defining the failure domain across which the data will   be spread. The number of data pools is unlimited, but the default pool must always be present. For example:</p> <pre><code>spec:\n  sharedFilesystem:\n    cephFS:\n    - name: cephfs-store\n      dataPools:\n      - name: default-pool\n        deviceClass: ssd\n        replicated:\n          size: 3\n        failureDomain: host\n      - name: second-pool\n        deviceClass: hdd\n        failureDomain: rack\n        erasureCoded:\n          dataChunks: 2\n          codingChunks: 1\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>replicated.size</code> is the number of full copies of data on multiple nodes.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>When using the non-recommended Ceph pools <code>replicated.size</code> of less than <code>3</code>, Ceph OSD removal cannot be performed. The minimal replica size equals a rounded up half of the specified <code>replicated.size</code>.</p> <p>For example, if <code>replicated.size</code> is <code>2</code>, the minimal replica size is <code>1</code>, and if <code>replicated.size</code> is <code>3</code>, then the minimal replica size is <code>2</code>. The replica size of <code>1</code> allows Ceph having PGs with only one Ceph OSD in the <code>acting</code> state, which may cause a <code>PG_TOO_DEGRADED</code> health warning that blocks Ceph OSD removal. We recommend setting <code>replicated.size</code> to <code>3</code> for each Ceph pool.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Modifying of <code>dataPools</code> on a deployed CephFS has no effect. You can manually adjust pool settings through the Ceph CLI. However, for any changes in <code>dataPools</code>, we recommend re-creating CephFS.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>metadataPool</code> - CephFS metadata pool spec that should only contain <code>replicated</code>, <code>deviceClass</code>, and <code>failureDomain</code>   parameters. The <code>failureDomain</code> parameter may be set to <code>host</code>, <code>rack</code> and so on,   defining the failure domain across which the data will be spread. Can use only <code>replicated</code> settings. For example:</p> <pre><code>spec:\n  sharedFilesystem:\n    cephFS:\n    - name: cephfs-store\n      metadataPool:\n        deviceClass: nvme\n        replicated:\n          size: 3\n        failureDomain: host\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>replicated.size</code> is the number of full copies of data on multiple nodes.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Modifying of <code>metadataPool</code> on a deployed CephFS has no effect. You can manually adjust pool settings through the Ceph CLI. However, for any changes in <code>metadataPool</code>, we recommend re-creating CephFS.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>preserveFilesystemOnDelete</code> - Defines whether to delete the data and metadata pools if CephFS is   deleted. Set to <code>true</code> to avoid occasional data loss in case of human error. However, for security reasons,   we recommend setting <code>preserveFilesystemOnDelete</code> to <code>false</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>metadataServer</code> - Metadata Server settings correspond to the Ceph MDS daemon settings. Contains the following fields:</p> <ul> <li><code>activeCount</code> - the number of active Ceph MDS instances. As a load   increases, CephFS will automatically partition the file system   across the Ceph MDS instances. Rook will create double the number   of Ceph MDS instances as requested by <code>activeCount</code>. The extra   instances will be in the standby mode for failover. We recommend specifying this parameter to <code>1</code> and   increasing the MDS daemons count only in case of a high load.</li> <li><code>activeStandby</code> - defines whether the extra Ceph MDS instances   will be in active standby mode and will keep a warm cache of the   file system metadata for faster failover. CephFS will assign the instances in failover pairs.   If <code>false</code>, the extra Ceph MDS instances will all be in passive standby mode and will   not maintain a warm cache of the metadata. The default value is <code>false</code>.</li> <li><code>resources</code> - represents Kubernetes resource requirements for Ceph MDS pods.</li> </ul> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>spec:\n  sharedFilesystem:\n    cephFS:\n    - name: cephfs-store\n      metadataServer:\n        activeCount: 1\n        activeStandby: false\n        resources: # example, non-prod values\n          requests:\n            memory: 1Gi\n            cpu: 1\n          limits:\n            memory: 2Gi\n            cpu: 2\n</code></pre> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"ops-guide/deployment/cephfs/#configure-cephfs","title":"Configure CephFS","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Optional.

The replica size of <code>1</code> allows Ceph having PGs with only one Ceph OSD in the <code>acting</code> state, which may cause a <code>PG_TOO_DEGRADED</code> health warning that blocks Ceph OSD removal. We recommend setting <code>replicated.size</code> to <code>3</code> for each Ceph pool.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>gateway</code> - Required.
